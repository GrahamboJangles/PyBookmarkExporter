# PyBookmarkExporter
Uses Python to import/export specific bookmark folders. Can be used to share bookmarks with other people.

# Directions
- First, run the script and select export mode. Then select a folder such as /Banking
- Second, have your friend run the script in import mode to import the bookmark folder to their browser.

# To do:
- Make the iterate_through_bookmarks() function recursive instead of manually defining the child folders
- Make the script OS agnostic
- Print all bookmarks to the console for the user when exporting
